                    <p>Hello, my name is Greg Colvin and I'm interested in learning more about coding and
                         web development.  I grew up in California, but have lived in Utah now for about 18 
                         years, so one might say I'm a certifiable Utahn.  I have a stong math background, 
                        and almost became a math teacher but decided it wasn't for me.  </p><br>
                    <p>I have always loved messing around with computers, whether it be trying to fix 
                        something, building them, or tinkering with them in general. I've been working in IT
                        at a print company in Provo for 12 years.  Although it's been mostly enjoyable, I'd love
                        to be able to gain additional skills and progress with another company doing something
                        different.</p><br>
                    <p>My wife of 8 years and I live in Lehi with our little Beagle named Newton.  He keeps me on
                        my toes, but is a pleasure to be around.  Last summer, the 3 of us had an adventure working
                        as camp hosts up in American Fork canyon.  Between cleaning fire pits and outhouses, I did as 
                        much reading as I could on HTML and CSS, and dabbled in Javascript.  Of course, practice is
                        the best teacher, so I decided to enroll in a boot camp to sharpen my skills.
